## 🤖 AI Analysis

The removal of the Character.isAlive field of type Boolean from the rick_morty_graphql schema may cause breaking changes for clients relying on this field, potentially affecting character filtering or sorting functionality, and impacting the overall user experience.

### 📊 Impact

- API consumers will no longer be able to query the isAlive status of characters, forcing them to adapt their queries and potentially leading to increased latency or errors if not handled properly
- Existing character filtering or sorting logic based on the isAlive field will be broken, requiring updates to maintain functionality
- Clients may need to implement workarounds, such as using alternative fields or making additional requests, to achieve the same functionality as before

### ⚠️ Risks

- Breaking changes may lead to a negative user experience due to errors or missing functionality, potentially resulting in a loss of users or revenue
- Incompatible API changes can cause security vulnerabilities if not properly handled, such as exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized access
- The removal of the isAlive field may indicate a larger shift in the API's data model, requiring clients to reassess their integration and potential investments in the API

# 🚨 API Drift Detected - MAJOR

**Run ID:** `1b3fb325`
**Severity:** MAJOR
**Affected APIs:** github_repo_ts, rick_morty_graphql
**Timestamp:** 2025-12-02T17:58:54.143Z

## 🤖 AI Analysis

The API schema has undergone changes, with additions and removals of fields in the github_repo_ts and rick_morty_graphql endpoints, potentially impacting compatibility and data handling for clients. The removal of Character.new_field_teste in rick_morty_graphql is a breaking change, while additions in github_repo_ts may require updates to client handling of description and language fields. These changes have implications for data processing, security, and client compatibility.

### 📊 Impact

- API consumers of github_repo_ts endpoint must update to handle new description and language fields, potentially requiring changes to data parsing and storage logic.
- Removal of campo_fake_para_demo and outro_campo_inexistente in github_repo_ts may cause issues for clients relying on these fields, despite them being marked as non-existent or for demo purposes.
- The removal of Character.new_field_teste:string in rick_morty_graphql is a breaking change, requiring clients to update their GraphQL queries to avoid errors.
- Clients may need to adapt error handling for cases where removed fields are still referenced in queries or payloads, ensuring robustness against potential errors.

### ⚠️ Risks

- Breaking changes in rick_morty_graphql may lead to client errors or failures if not properly updated, potentially impacting user experience and business operations.
- Incompatible changes could expose security vulnerabilities if not properly handled, such as incorrect data validation or unauthorized access due to outdated client logic.
- The introduction of new fields like description and language in github_repo_ts may introduce additional attack surfaces if not properly validated and sanitized, posing security risks.
- Business logic relying on the removed fields may be disrupted, requiring updates to ensure continuity of operations and data integrity.
